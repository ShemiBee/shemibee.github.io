<p> "The more you are like <b> yourself </b> the less you are like anyone else, which makes you <u> unique </u>" - Walt
Disney. </br >

I could not think of a better way to describe myself. With all I am, I am definitely a unique character who loves exploring
and asking questions that allow me to think outside of the box!

<i>Outside the workplace or classroom you would find me:</i>
<u1>
Watching Anime
Singing
Walking and embracing the beauty of mother nature
</u1>

</br>

If you need a laugh, a high-five and a downright loyal person to turn to, I'm your gal.

I'm also becoming more open to the vast world of technology (which has been a thrilling adventure). I'm definitely
learning what it means to be (and stay) unfomfortable! It's been a bumpy ride, but I'm loving the person I have become
due to it.</p>
